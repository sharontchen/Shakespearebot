# CS 155 Miniproject 3: Shakespearebot 5000

In this project, we attempt to generate Shakespearean sonnets by training various models on the entire corpus of Shakespeareâ€™s sonnets. We tested the naive Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and improved it by constraining the model to fit the iambic pentameter and rhyming scheme of a Shakespearean sonnet. We also tried poem generation with recurrent neural networks (character-based LSTM) model and compared our results.

We use the following modules:

## Requirements
- Python 3  
- python-Levenshtein==0.12.0  
- Keras  
- numpy
- matplotlib

##  Poetry-Tools
Github Repository: https://github.com/hyperreality/Poetry-Tools

- Performs prosodic analysis of poetry.  
- Estimates rhyme scheme and metre using CMUDict, compares them against common forms using Levenshtein distance, and combines the results to guess the form of the poem.  
- Contains a rhymes function that is faster than any other I have found.
