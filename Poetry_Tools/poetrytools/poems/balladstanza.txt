My wings shall ride the silken morn,
Covering the silent sunlit sky,
Under Cancer and Capricorn,
Flying where no bird can fly.

My wings cover the tapestried earth,
And the blue silken sea,
Flying high see the sun give birth,
The world below in apogee.

My wings cover the entire world,
Over the conquered mountain,
Where cloud pennants are unfurled,
Over which I rule as sovereign.

My wings now turn for what is home,
Whispering and singing in flight,
The day is done, no time to roam,
Descending towards the night.
